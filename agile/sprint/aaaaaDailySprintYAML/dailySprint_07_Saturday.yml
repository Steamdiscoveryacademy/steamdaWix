Brainstorm enrollmentstates UI:
      - States:
            - mimimize
            - make Bootstrap-primary
            - test that Primary can Expand the state(s)
                  - thus anything like it can expand a State as needbe
            
      - Code:
            - identify on UI and then Remove Code:
                  - all JUST BUTTONs then CALL - removed FIRST
                  - then and ONLY THEN remove from UI
            - what code remains:
                  - display
            - what code is tossed:
                  - Loop-Switch
                        - as opposed to Loop that calls a Switch

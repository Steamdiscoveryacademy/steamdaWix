The timeline is this: 
• I cannot control that WiX behaves drastically differently 3 and a half months after I successfully build a mechanism
to take webhook data. Because of this, I want to be the only person that touches the 'Final' version of the FormStack
forms.

• The steps process of 'Process Web Hooks' is working completely and accurately as best I can tell.

• The process whereby the 18 steps from Confirmed Application to Fully Loaded Member, Contact and Database data is
automatically populated is working.

• as I was racing to perform the above steps for the Week 6 Roster there came a point where I realized taht I was not
going to win that race, so as I documented in Google Chat, I switched to the (known, necessary task) of building a
Robust, Extensible and User-Friendly (meaning you and any staff you hire) mechanism for achieving what was necessily a
laborious task whereby I could watch every step, into an abreviated series of logically connected steps that gave ample
opportunity to step through and watch the results as the steps pass. (As with anything, when the time is right I can add
a "Let it Rip" button to do the entire task without steps, or more accurately, a single step.)

• I did do work while in Boston, but obviously, it was here and there around wedding events so I didn't focus on this
enourmous task. I got some other really good things done, important things, but I knew I was away from the focus.

• I did do work while visiting with you in Charlottesville. As the focus was on learning and observing and interacting
in a way that was special to being in Charlottesville so I didn't focus on this enourmous task. Again, I got some other really
good things done. I tried to get back to the focus on Enrollment, by way of taking markers and a ruler and so on back to the hotel 


• Timeline: I think I would have been done before the trip if the entire Web Hook mechanism didn't blow-up in my face,
and then after taking the time to jump through the hoops that the help-desk set up for me they just curtly refused to take
any responsibility for something that had been working for 3 1/2 months abruptly stopped working. Every single test I
ran since then has taken another hunk of time where I had to manually send it to the webhook.site (site), manually
gather it from there, and then post it to WiX via yet another tool, PostMan.

• There is a problem with my code conveying the 

• Yesterday, as I was getting back in the groove, you indicated that the Fall Schedule was your priority. That is the
only time that my main focus has not been on the Enrollment Process (not just 'contacts' but Primary Parents, Students
and Secondary Parents as Individuals and as a Family), above caveats excepted, of course.

• Then I get a call from Mike telling me to ignore the Fall and get back to the Post Enrollment process. I finished the
call saying, "Great, I'll get back to the Post Enrollment task."

• Then mid late-morning (noon for you), I began Google-Chatting, and when it reached a point where I couldn't really
accomplish anything without postpoining some of the things you were asking me to respond about, I let chat go.

• Then as per our agreement, when you texted me the same message, I stopped what I was doing to compose this. 

• Now, after I proof-read it and so on, I will Post it to Google-Chat and alert you via text that it is there for you.

I hope this answers you questions.

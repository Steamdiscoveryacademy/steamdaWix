#! FYI, I have decided, for the most part, to go with the Default Field Key based
# on Field Name. For example "Student First" has the key "studentFirst" (Camel
# Case: No Spaces, all words except first is Capitalized). EXCEPT: 
# ø our ID's (like Primary Parent ID, Family ID, Household ID, Term ID). Instead
# these will be keyed with "id" as the first part of the Key for really
# important keys I will go with condensed Abbreviation, for not so important
# ID's just 'id' and the ID Name. Respectively (idPP, idFM, idHH, idTerm) 
# ø any field whose sole reason for being is to hold JSON data. Since this will
# NEVER be really rendered to any user as such, these will be prefixed with
# 'json' and then the normal name. Therefore, Enrollment JSON, Corollary JSON
# and Status Notes JSON will be, respectively, jsonEnrollment, jsonCorollary,
# jsonStatusNotes.

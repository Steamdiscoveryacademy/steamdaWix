This file will contain much code that may be sourced HERE

There will be a Folder for each non-Empty Record in the WiX Table 'Sourced JSON'

Each folder WILL contain a dox.json file keeping true to the one I created for ≈ Intl.DateTimeFormat() ≈ stuff.

Some folders will also contain JavaScript code that can Generate the Code ( ≈ Post Enrollment Bootstrap Messaging ≈ )

In some cases for the two above the dox.json folder will contain a link to the actual source and sometimes this is in
the workspace (steamdaCorollary)
